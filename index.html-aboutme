<h1>Basketball<h1>

  <p>
    I began playing basketball at around the age of 10 and it has became a very large part of my life.
    I eventually grew a passion for the game and that lead me to spending a majority of my free time practicing it.
    Whether it be with friends, a team, or by myself I would take every chance I had to practice, so much so
    that there has only been a few days that come to mind in the past few years where I have not either played
    basketball or done something else to better my game.

      <h2>Family<h2>

        <p>
          Most of my time spend outside of playing basketball would be with my family or
          one of my close friends that I basically consider family. Our favorite activity together would definitely
          be watching TV shows/movies. Some of our favorites from over quarentine would have to be "Outer Banks" and
          "Parks and Recreation".
